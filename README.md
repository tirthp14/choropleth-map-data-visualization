# Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map
## The choropleth map displays the percentage of adults age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher between 2010 - 2014 in the USA. The data is portrayed in form of a map that displays information when hovered over the different states. It also includes a legend that shows the percentages across the country in equal intervals.
